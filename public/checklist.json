The easiest way to make a strong password is by making it long (12+ characters) — consider using a 'passphrase' made up of many words. Alternatively, use a password generator to create a long, strong random password. Have a play with [Security.org's How Secure Is My Password?](https://security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/), to get an idea of how quickly common passwords can be cracked.

It is also possible for keyloggers to be planted inside the keyboard housing, so look for any signs that the case has been tampered with, and consider bringing your own keyboard to work.

Since the browser communicates directly with the device, it cannot be fooled as to which host is requesting authentication because the TLS certificate is checked. [This post](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/71704) is a good explanation of the security of using FIDO U2F tokens. Of course, it is important to store the physical key somewhere safe or keep it on your person. Some online accounts allow for several methods of 2FA to be enabled."

This is where [anything]@yourdomain.com will arrive in your inbox, allowing you to use a different email for each account (see [Mail Alias Providers](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy#mail-forwarding)). Usernames are easier since you can use your password manager to generate, store, and auto-fill these. Virtual phone numbers can be generated through your VOIP provider."
